Solution:

Here's a solution to the given problem statement.

Application Flow:

The server application will be started on port 8080 using express.js
Two endpoints will be implemented for the given problem statement:
PUT /vccl: This endpoint will receive the updated copy of the VCCL file and update it in the server's memory. If the file is more than 1 day old, it will be rejected and not updated.
GET /vccl/:id: This endpoint will receive an ID number and check if it exists in the VCCL. If it exists, it will return a JSON object with the ID and status "canceled". If it does not exist, it will return a JSON object with the ID and status "valid".
Basic functionality of the program:

The program meets the given specification and fulfills the requirements.
The program runs on Node.js current LTS release (18.x at the time of this writing) and is written using express.js.
The program serves the application directly on port 8080, using plain HTTP.
The program implements two endpoints as described in the problem statement.
Documentation and Communication:

The code is properly documented with comments explaining what each block of code is doing and why.
The README file includes instructions on how to run the application.
The README file also includes a brief explanation of the application flow and how the program meets the given requirements.
Defensive coding:

The program anticipates ways things can break and proactively addresses them.
The program checks if the VCCL file is more than 1 day old and rejects it if it is.
The program checks if the ID number is valid (has only digits) before checking if it exists in the VCCL.
Security:

The program implements basic precautions to prevent the service from being exploited.
The program uses express.js's bodyParser middleware to limit the size of the incoming request body.
The program only allows the VCCL file to be updated if it is sent using the PUT method and if it is a CSV file.
The program checks if the ID number is valid (has only digits) to prevent SQL injection attacks.
However, the program does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms.
Test cases:

The program includes test cases to ensure that it works as expected.
The test cases cover both endpoints and edge cases such as invalid input and expired VCCL file.
Instructions to run the application:
